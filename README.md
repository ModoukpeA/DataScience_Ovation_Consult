Data analysis first practical project using Pandas, NumPy , Matplotlib libraries.


********************************************************************************
I have been asked to make a brief and simple analysis on a few (not more than 15) enterprises in Benin Republic. 
Basically, it's all about an excel sheet that contains some non-numerical data on enterprises (name, surname, mail, contact...)
The whole work is about retrieving some data and giving out the percentage of women owning their staturps based on the sheet provided.
********************************************************************************
The second project is about the analysis of a sheet obtained with google forms (A form to ask about the importance of mentorship for a professional life)
Though the dataset is very small, I try to make some analysis [the dominated gender, the importance of mentorship according to each sex group, the age group and others criteria]
