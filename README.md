********************************************************************************
I have been asked to make a brief and simple analysis on a few (not more than 15) enterprises in Benin Republic. 
Basically, it's all about an excel sheet that contains some non-numerical data on enterprises (name, surname, mail, contact...)
The whole work is about retrieving some data and giving out the percentage of women owning their staturps based on the sheet provided.
